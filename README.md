# Geometry Nodes User Library Addon for Blender
A simple script addon to access your personal Geometry nodes presets, from the Add menu, with categories and project paths.

## Acknowledgments

> *If you are using the node-presets.py addon, you may have find out that it includes all types of nodes in only one category. The asset manager is a cool option too, but as it doesnt require an image preview, why not getting our favorite geometry node presets directly from the editor! ;)*
