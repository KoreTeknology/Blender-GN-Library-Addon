# Geometry Nodes User Library Addon for Blender
A simple script addon for Blender 3.1+ to access your **personal Geometry nodes presets**, from the Add menu. It includes **several library paths and categories settings** in the addon preferences panel. **"Quick access to your geometry nodegroups using the shortcut MAJ+A"**, located on top of your geometry node editor area.

## Acknowledgments

> *If you are using the node-presets.py addon, you may have find out that it includes all types of nodes in only one category. The asset manager is a cool option too, but as it doesnt require an image preview or any tags, why not getting our favorite geometry node presets directly from the Geometry nodes editor itself?! ;)*
